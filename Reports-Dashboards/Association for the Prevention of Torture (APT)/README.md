# Torture Prevention: A 40-Year Progress Report

This project is a data visualization built in Power BI for the **Association for the Prevention of Torture (APT)**. It showcases global progress in preventing and prohibiting torture over the last 40 years, from 1984 (the adoption of the UN Convention against Torture) to 2024, through the lens of 8 key indicators.

## Project Background

**APT Vision and Mission**  
The Association for the Prevention of Torture envisions a world without torture or ill-treatment. Their mission is to:
1. Influence legal frameworks, policies, and practices to reduce risks of torture.
2. Bring together relevant actors to foster dialogue and identify solutions.
3. Support change-makers with expertise and resources.

APT works to create an ecosystem where torture is unlikely to occur, contributing to stronger democratic societies where people are safe and free.

**About the Report**  
This project aims to communicate the prohibition and prevention of torture through inspiring and data-driven visualizations. Despite its absolute prohibition, torture continues to exist, often targeting the most vulnerable groups. However, data suggests measurable progress has been made since the UN Convention against Torture's adoption in 1984. 

The dashboard uses 8 indicators identified by APT to measure this progress and provides a 40-year analysis of global trends. It serves as a call to action to further the fight against torture and encourage governments to adopt and implement laws and policies that reduce its occurrence.
